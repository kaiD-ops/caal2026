class HilbertScan(nn.Module):
    """
    Reorders pixels according to a Hilbert Curve for multi-channel images.
    
    The Hilbert curve is a space-filling curve that preserves spatial locality
    when mapping 2D coordinates to 1D sequences. This module applies the same
    Hilbert curve pattern to each channel independently, then reorganizes the
    output so the sequence dimension comes first.
    
    Supports grayscale (C=1) or RGB (C=3) images.
    
    Attributes
    ----------
    indices : torch.LongTensor
        Precomputed Hilbert curve indices for a 64×64 grid, stored as a
        non-trainable buffer.
    
    Input
    -----
    x : torch.Tensor
        Input tensor of shape (B, C, H, W), where
        B : batch size
        C : number of channels (1 for grayscale, 3 for RGB)
        H : height (64)
        W : width (64)
    
    Returns
    -------
    out : torch.Tensor
        Reordered tensor of shape (B, seq_len, C) where seq_len = H*W = 4096.
        Pixels are arranged according to the Hilbert curve traversal order.

        Convert 1D Hilbert curve distance to 2D coordinates.
        
        This implements the recursive Hilbert curve mapping algorithm that converts
        a linear distance along the curve to (x, y) coordinates. The algorithm works
        by recursively dividing the space into four quadrants and applying appropriate
        rotations and reflections at each level.
        
        Parameters
        ----------
        n : int
            Size of the grid (must be a power of 2).
        d : int
            Distance along the Hilbert curve (0 to n²-1).
        
        Returns
        -------
        tuple of int
            (x, y) coordinates in the grid.
            
        Algorithm
        ---------
        The Hilbert curve fills a 2D space by recursively visiting four quadrants:
        1. Bottom-left (rotated and reflected)
        2. Top-left (no transformation)
        3. Top-right (no transformation)
        4. Bottom-right (rotated and reflected opposite direction)
        
        For each position d, we determine:
        - Which quadrant it falls into
        - Position within that quadrant
        - Apply transformations and recurse
